## DFA-Based-Approach-for-Skill-Matching-in-Resume-Screening
This project automates resume screening using a Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)-based skill-matching algorithm. This will be run using streamlit as we use python and easy to make this prototype

Any lapses in the app/prototype can be improved as this prototype will only serve as a guide and visualization of the research


## Features
- **File Upload:** Handles file upload (PDF), can handle multiple uploads
- **Skill Matching:** Scans resumes and identifies required skills using DFA.
- **Multi-pattern Detection:** Handles multiple skill patterns efficiently.
- **Output Reports:** Generates a list of matched and missing skills for each resume.





## Run the Script
   - Navigate to the `src` folder where `main.py` is stored and run:
     
 streamlit run __name of the py. file
