## DFA-Based-Approach-for-Skill-Matching-in-Resume-Screening
This project automates resume screening using a Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)-based skill-matching algorithm. It helps recruiters process large volumes of resumes efficiently by detecting and matching candidate skills with job requirements.

## Features
- **Skill Matching:** Scans resumes and identifies required skills using DFA.
- **Multi-pattern Detection:** Handles multiple skill patterns efficiently.
- **Output Reports:** Generates a list of matched and missing skills for each resume.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Basic knowledge of file structures and Python environment setup.

## Installation
